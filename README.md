A weird prototype of an adventure game that I came up with after seeing an article about the Conan Doyle estate suing Netflix because Enola Holmes made Sherlock too respecful of women.
I was looking for an excuse to have a go at programming a point-and-click adventure game and the idea made me laugh so I had a go at it. I also wanted to see how far I could get only using art I made myself which was certainly a bold choice.
I still really like the idea and would like to continue it one day if I can convince someone to write a good comedy mystery story for me.
